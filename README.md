## About the Project:<span>  📚<span/>

BetterBuy a NFT based digital warranties represent ownership of luxury items. For instance, a digital token on the blockchain could represent the ownership for a certain model of mobile phone created by your company. The Digital Warranties on BetterBuy.com are minted using a single smart contract that has different Token IDs and Metadata. The Metadata of an NFT is created to include the wallet address of the owner. Only the owner of an NFT with a wallet address included in the metadata can import the NFT into their wallet. The Metadata of each product also includes its product name, serial number, warranty duration, product description, warranty conditions as well as a timestamp for when it was issued and for how long it’s been active. Customer will receive an email containing a link to the transaction that enables him/her to import the Digital Warranty into his/her wallet according to his Token Address and Token ID.
